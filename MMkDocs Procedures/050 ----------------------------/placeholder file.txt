placeholder file.txt

If a folder does not contain one or more files, then the 
Windows version of Git will not push this folder to GitHub.  

After doing a git push operation, when you look in the GitHub 
repo, the empty folder will not be there. 

So, I have created this placeholder file to force the local 
Git program to properly push everything to GitHub.

GSG-Abbreviations.txt
---------------------


Abbreviations used in the njs-base-app01 app to 
construct data Table names, component names, css 
variable names, and program variable names.  

I want to use important names that are very self-explanatory such as: 
Customer-Address-List or Event-Venue-Manager.  However, names like 
these can easily get very long.  So, we will use well-documented 
abbreviations for the second, third, and fourth names that may be 
combined when we construct important names.  The first word should 
NOT be abbreviated. 
Examples: 
Use Customer-Addr-List  instead of Customer-Address-List 
Use Event-Venue-Mgr instead of Event-Venue-Manager.
